### Introduction
This app began life as a final project for a python class I took in the fall of 2023. While I had it working at the end of the semester. I had not completed all of the features I wanted to include. So I decided to revisit the app and finish it.

As you can see it is a simple app, but it now has the major features I orignally envisioned. Which are:

- Current Temperature and Conditions
- More detailed weather information including high and sunrie, sunset, humidity, and wind speed
- A multi day forecast section
- A section for favorite locations
- Persistent user preferences
